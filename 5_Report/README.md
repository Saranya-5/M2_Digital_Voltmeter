# INTRODUCTION 
This project is designed using a Atmega 32 microcontroller from range 0-5v.This is a simplest possible digital voltmeter with Atmel AVR microcontroller and LCD display.

## COMPONENTS REQUIRED
 Atmega 32,Power supply, 100uF capacitor, 100 nF capacitor,Resistor

# ADVANTAGES
- Digital display of the output eliminates  human reading error.
- Readings are accurate and fast compared to analog meters.
- Digital voltmeter is more stable and realable.
- smaller in size and cost effective.

# DISADVANTAGES
- Digital voltmeter are prone to damage if the voltage is increased beyond the limit.
- The display depends on the external power source or battery.
- When a fluctuation occurs in a circuit,the digital voltmeter cannot read and display an error.
- Speed of operation is limited due to digitizing circuit in digital voltmeter.
